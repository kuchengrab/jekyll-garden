# Overview of Note-Taking Apps
list of markdown-based apps for personal knowledge management (PKM), with wiki and/or journaling and todo functions.

## shortlist
### dendron
- https://www.dendron.so/
-
  > *The hierarchical note taking tool that grows as you do!*
  *Dendron is an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool built on top of VSCode.*
- #opensource , #markdown , VScode, #zotero , #backlinks , #graph-view, #templates
- emphasises a good naming scheme for notes (continually adapt through "refactoring"), e.g. `book.hooks-bell-feminism-is-for-everybody.notes`
- for very advanced users/programmers (familiar with VScode)
  - but seems really advanced, thought-through and cool! ðŸ¤“
  - style can be adapted with CSS
  - nice publishing functionality
- most advanced open source tool, but considerable lerning curve


### zettlr
- https://zettlr.com/

  > *A Markdown Editor for the 21st century.*
- #markdown , #tags , #id #opensource , #zotero , #pandoc , ui #4/5
- (-) no backlinks, no graph view, no auto-suggest
  - zettlr doesn't use a database, therefore backlinks would have to be created for each note individually = slow, resource hungry
  - link = search
- zettelkasten with ID-pattern ("raw" in text)
- metadata with YAML (example)
    ```
    ---
    title: "Your document's title"
    keywords:
      - A keyword
      - Another keyword
    author:
      - The Zettlr Team
    ...
    ```
- (+) zettlr recognizes different kinds of tags, from YAML and hashtags
  - not compatible with nested tags
- (+) integration with pandoc & zotero (Better BibTeX references)

### obsidian
- https://obsidian.md/
  > *A second brain, for you, forever.*
  *Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.*
- workspaces (notebooks), #tags , #graph-view , #backlinks , #proprietary
- optional: zettelkasten-id, journaling, `[[Wiki-Links]]` etc.
- sleek UI #5/5
- possible to use folders (which have no impact on internal links), support for nested tags (e.g. `Berlin/Alexanderplatz`) 
- judgement: looks very good, very functional. unfortunately not open source

## conceptually slightly different
### logseq
- https://logseq.com
  > *A privacy-first, open-source (frontend now, backend later) platform for knowledge sharing and management.*

![](media/upload_2fa11f9a1a386b21f8587357aada82c0.png)
- synchronization with github repository
- almost clone of *[roam research](https://md.zusammenkunft.berlin/#roam-research)* , #relational , #opensource , #graph-view #backlinks
- uses a database = changes in files are not automatically reflected in app, but [[backlinking]] is enabled
- very sleek UI
- every bullet point can be referenced or embedded
- limited #markdown (no headings), strange own #syntax with `#` at the beginning of each line (â—¦bullet point), representing indentation (example)
  ```

  ## **logseq**
  ### https://logseq.com
  ### 
  > _A privacy-first, open-source (frontend now, backend later) platform for knowledge sharing and management._
  ### synchronization with github repository
  ```
	 
- cool concept, but not copatible with other tools, rather online-first than local-first


### joplin
- https://joplinapp.org/
  > *Joplin - an open source note taking and to-do application with synchronization capabilities for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.*
- #markdown , #tags , #opensource
- very similar to Evernote, focus on synchronization with different devices
- cryptic format (note-id as filename, but acceptable export to proper #markdown )
  - ![](media/upload_b5514f721c2033503a24090e709b23d1.png)
  - metadata at the end of file (example)
